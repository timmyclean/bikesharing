# CitiBike in Des Moines?

## Overview
 * Our task is to convince potential investors that the extremely popular "Citi Bike" program in New York City is the right fit for Des Moines, Iowa.
 * We analyzed data from New York studing, trip duration, bike usage, gender mix and more. 
 * Our reults will conclude that this is an amazing opportunity and should not be missed.


## Results
 * the following graphs and data visualizations were created by our team using Tableau and the full Story can be seen there at [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tim.mclean#!/vizhome/CitiBikeinDesMoinesProject/Story1?publish=yes)

 1) We show in the following graph the amazing popularity of the program. We feel this will translate to the Des Moines demographic. It will be substantially benefical to suscribe to the service as opposed to to using on a "per basis". We feel this will a big attraction to Des Moines Resisdents.

Here we see the immense popularity of the program for short trips. With strategically placed bike hubs our clients will be able to use bikes to either get to work or use the bikes to get from Public transit to work

This again reiterates the last point but also shows that there is high demand on the weekend. Showing we can capture the Female and Male market.

This graph very importantly shows that Citibike has strong numbers and use with mid 20's to 50 yr olds this lies right in the sweet spot of Des Moines median age according to census data. https://datausa.io/profile/geo/des-moines-ia/#about

## Conclusion

* As we see this program although would not be as large as the NYC program it can stil be very effective, local business would benefit from having potential clients being able to see more of Downtown Des Moines. Traffic congestion would be reduced in the Downtown area. The ability to have a local company sponsor the program would be great brand recognition. We have displayed a local map of Des Moines to give you an idea of where potential bike hubs could go.

With this map we can see the potential to have suscribers that use the service for work on our side and the leisure client to be more that satisfied as well.

Thank you for your time and we hope to be Biking with you soon.
